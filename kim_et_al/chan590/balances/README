The files in this directory (chan590/balances) contain terms in the
balance equation for the reynolds stress and turbulent kinetic energy
extracted from direct numerical simulations of fully developed plane
turbulent channel flow at Re_tau=590. The simulations are reported in
"DNS of Turbulent Channel Flow up to Re_tau=590," by R. D. Moser,
J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1999 (Phys. Fluids, vol 11, pg 943-945).

This directory contains 5 files named chan590.<extension>, where
the extension indicates the contents of the file. The extensions are

  kbal  -- balance of the turbulent kinetic energy

  uubal -- balance of the streamwise velocity variance

  vvbal -- balance of the wall-normal velocity variance

  wwbal -- balance of the spanwise velocity variance

  uvbal -- balance of the Reynolds shear stress

Note that some of the quantities reported in these files should be
zero by statistical symmetries (e.g. the reynolds stress components uw
and vw). They are included as an indication of the quality of the
statistics.

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
r-moser@uiuc.edu.
