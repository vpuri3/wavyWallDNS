The files in this directory (chan590/correlations) contain
one-dimensional two-point correlations extracted from direct numerical
simulations of fully developed plane turbulent channel flow at
Re_tau=590. The simulations are reported in "DNS of Turbulent Channel
Flow up to Re_tau=590," by R. D. Moser, J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1999
(Phys. Fluids, vol 11, pg 943-945).

This directory contains a set of files named
chan590.<extension>.<number>, where the number indicates the
y-location of the correlations (in + units rounded to the nearest
integer), and the extension indicates the type of correlations in the
file. The extensions are

  xcorr -- 1-D auto-correlations in the x-direction 

  xccorr -- 1-D cross-correlations in the x-direction 

  zcorr -- 1-D auto-correlations in the z-direction 

  zccorr -- 1-D cross-correlations in the z-direction 

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
r-moser@uiuc.edu.
