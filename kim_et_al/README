The files in this directory tree contain statistical data extracted
from direct numerical simulations of fully developed plane turbulent
channel flow. There are three cases at three different Reynolds
numbers: nominal Reynolds numbers based on U_tau (the friction
velocity) and h (channel half-width) are 180, 395 and 590.  The
simulations are reported in "DNS of Turbulent Channel Flow up to
Re_tau=590," by R. D. Moser, J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1998 (Phys. Fluids,
vol 11, pg 943-945).

The data for each case are in directories chan180, chan395 and chan590
respectively.  Each of these directories contains 5 subdirectories
containing the actual data:

  balances -- Terms in the Reynolds stress and kinetic energy 
              balance equations

  correlations -- 1-D two-point correlations and cross correlations

  pdfs -- probability density functions of velocity and pressure 

  profiles -- Mean, variance, skewness and flatness profiles
  
  spectra -- 1-D energy spectra

The file chandata.tar.gz in this directory is a gzipped tar file
containing all the data.

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
r-moser@uiuc.edu.
