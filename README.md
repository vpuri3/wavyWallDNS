Direct Numerical Simulations of turbulent flows over smooth and rough wavy walls has been conducted. The Smooth Wavy Wall is described by a sinusoidal wave in the streamwise direction with amplitude to wavelength ratio $a/\lambda=0.05$. Small-amplitude sinusoidal roughness elements are superimposed on to the Smooth Wavy Wall case to obtain the Rough Wavy Wall case. The smaller undulations on the Rough Wavy Wall represent details that a Large Eddy Simulation may not be able to resolve, but whose effects should be reflected on the resolved flow field. The flows are characterised by Reynolds number of $2390$ based on bulk velocity and channel half-height. The effects of the surface geometry are felt on the outer layer of the boundary layer. This observation contrasts with the Townsend hypothesis, that if your surface roughness is smaller than the Kolmogrov lengthscale then the effects of the roughness may not be felt on the flow.

The budget terms of the Reynolds Stress Transport Equations have been computed for both cases. mention what budget terms revel about differences bw SWW, RWW. The budget terms reveal strong coupling between wall-topography and turbulence dynamics near the wall.

Flow separation at the crest of the Smooth Wavy Wall and the formation of a persistent recirculation zone near the trough are observed along with a shear layer spanning multiple wavelengths.
