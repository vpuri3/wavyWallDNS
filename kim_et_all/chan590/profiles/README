The files in this directory (chan590/profiles) contain profiles of
mean, variance, skewness and flatness extracted from direct numerical
simulations of fully developed plane turbulent channel flow at
Re_tau=590. The simulations are reported in "DNS of Turbulent Channel
Flow up to Re_tau=590," by R. D. Moser, J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1999
(Phys. Fluids, vol 11, pg 943-945).

This directory contains six files named chan590.<extension>, where
the extension indicates the contents of the file. The extensions are

  flat -- velocity and pressure flatness factors

  means -- profiles of mean velocities and pressures and their derivatives

  reystress -- components of the Reynolds stress tensor

  skew -- velocity and pressure skewness
 
  velp -- velocity-pressure correlations

  vortvar -- variance of the vorticity fluctuations

Note that some of the quantities reported in these files should be
zero by statistical symmetries (e.g. the reynolds stress components uw
and vw). They are included as an indication of the quality of the
statistics.

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
r-moser@uiuc.edu.
