The files in this directory (chan590/spectra) contain one-dimensional
spectra extracted from direct numerical simulations of fully developed
plane turbulent channel flow at Re_tau=590. The simulations are
reported in "DNS of Turbulent Channel Flow up to Re_tau=590," by
R. D. Moser, J. Kim & N. N. Mansour, 1999 (Phys. Fluids, vol 11, pg
943-945).

This directory contains a set of files named
chan590.<extension>.<number>, where the number indicates the
y-location of the spectra (in + units rounded to the nearest integer),
and the extension indicates the type of spectra in the file. The
extensions are

  xspec -- 1-D spectra in the x-direction 

  zspec -- 1-D spectra in the z-direction 

Please report any problems with the data to R. D. Moser
r-moser@uiuc.edu.
