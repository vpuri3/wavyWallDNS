The files XLAM00 to XLAM09 contain data of case wb3 from 
Hudson (1993) at 10 streamwise positions, where

y: 	height over the surface in [cm]
v1avg:	U      [cm/s]        mean velocity
v2avg:	V      [cm/s]        mean velocity
v1':	rms(u) [cm/s]        rms velocity
v2':	rms(v) [cm/s]        rms velocity
RS':    u'v'   [cm^2/s^2]    Reynolds stress

For other quantities refer to the data files.

U_b= 8.64 cm/s 	        : bulk velocity in the lower channel half
Re_h=U_b*h / nu= 2390	: Reynolds number

The friction velocity at the wavy wall is u_tau_wa = 1.29 cm/s.

** ATTENTION ** All velocities in the files have to be multiplied 
by sqrt(2).  (The article from Hudson et a. (1996) contains the
corrected data.)  This results in e.g. Re_h = 3380.

In XLAM01 the sign of the v-velocity is changed, so that it has
a downward direction (as in the thesis). XLAM01BAK contains the data
as provided by Hudson.

The file pressure.dat contains pressure data, calculated from the 
velocity data by Hudson (for corrected velocities).
